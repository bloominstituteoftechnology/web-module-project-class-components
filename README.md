# Class Based Components - React Todo

We are going to practice building class components with this project. Even though hooks are gaining popularity among react developers, class components are going to be around for a long time. It's imperative that you get used to class components, and feel comfortable working with them since you'll most likely encounter them when you are hired to work at a React app.

## Skills You Will Practice

- Creating class-components from scratch
- Storing state in the top-level component, and sharing it with descendant components via props
- Handling form-related events like `change` and `submit`

## Introduction

In this project you will build an application that allows for todos to be added, completed and removed from view. This application should:

- Use [this gif](./todo.gif) as inspiration for building the DOM.
- Hold all todos in state within the `App.js` component. This slice of state should look like the following:

  ```js
  [
    {
      name: 'Organize Garage',
      id: 1528817077286, // could look different, you could use a timestamp to generate it
      completed: false
    },
    {
      name: 'Bake Cookies',
      id: 1528817084358,
      completed: false
    }
  ]
  ```

- Allow for a todo's "completed" status to be toggled when clicking on an item.
- Allow for a todo to be added when submitting the todo form component.
- Allow for completed todos to be filtered out when clicking the clear completed button.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- Fork, clone, and `npm install`.
- Launch the project on a development server executing `npm run dev`.
- Visit your widget by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` with Chrome.

### Task 2: Project Requirements

- **Build all components as class components. Find them inside `frontend/components`.**
- **Don't focus on styling. We want you to worry about function over form today.**
- Your todo list should display a list of todos, an input field, a submit button, and a button to filter out completed todos.
- `<App />` will hold all the data needed for this project. -- check
  - All of your application data will be stored here on `<App />`. -- check
  - All of your `handler` functions should live here on `<App />`. -- check
- `<TodoList />` receives your todos array and iterates over the list generating a new `<Todo />` for each element in the array. -- check
- `<Todo />` is a component that takes in the `todo` data and displays the task to the screen. -- check
- `<Form />` will hold your input field and your `Add Todo` and `Clear Completed` buttons. --check
  - Your input field should take in user input, and allow a user to press `Enter` or click on the `Submit Button` to add a todo to your list. -- check
  - Once a todo is submitted, the Todo List should re-render and show the added todo. -- check

## Submission Format

- [ ] Only work on main.
- [ ] Try to avoid committing broken code.
- [ ] Make sure to push code at regular intervals.
